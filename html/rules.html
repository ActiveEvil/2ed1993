                    In Warhammer 40,000, each unit, model, or item is worth a certain number of
                    points&mdash;representative of its relative impact on the table. Armies are built by spending points
                    up to an agreed maximum. This is referred to as the <strong>Game Size</strong>.

                    Games can be any size, from small skirmishes up to sprawling mass battles. Some recommended games
                    sizes are:

                <p>
                    To put together an army, points are spent on units and wargear from one or more army lists. Army
                    lists detail which units and equipment are available when constructing a given force&mdash;and how
                    many points they cost&mdash;as well as any army specific rules and/or constraints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although it is not a requirement to spend every single point, it is advisable to try to use as many
                    points as possible&mdash;wargear can help with this.

                <p>
                    4 turns is considered the &quot;default&quot; length for a game; however, players can agree to alter
                    this as
                    they see fit&mdash;extending on a turn-by-turn basis until there is a clear winner, or ending it
                    prematurely if it is a foregone conclusion. Some missions or scenarios may also dictate a specific
                    game length.

                <p>
                    During this step, players construct the battlefield for the game. A basic way to do this is to
                    take turns placing terrain so that no player has a particular tactical advantage due to the
                    landscape.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another option is to work together to create a board that fits a certain narrative theme, such as a
                    pitched battle or a last stand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is no specific requirement for what type or how much terrain is placed, but the general
                    consensus is that the game plays better&mdash;and looks better&mdash;with more terrain.

                    In the simplest game of Warhammer 40,000, the objective is purely to destroy the opponent&apos;s
                    army. To give this more flavor, players can define mission objectives for each army. These can be
                    decided in one of two ways:</p>
                <h4>
                    Mission Cards
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Mission cards define one or more objectives and the rewards for accomplishing them. If both sides
                    agree, players may randomly draw one each.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Scenarios
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A scenario is a narrative through-line for a game&mdash;&quot;capture the space port&quot; or
                    &quot;hold out until
                    reinforcements arrive&quot;. A great source of inspiration for this are old White Dwarf battle
                    reports—a
                    personal favorite being <em>Last Stand at Glazer&apos;s Creek</em> from White Dwarf 222. </p>

                <p>The standard way to win a game of Warhammer 40,000 is to score the most <strong>Victory
                        Points</strong>; however, for some scenarios it may be preferable to define a specific win
                    condition&mdash;escaping from a table edge, surviving for X turns, etc.</p>

                <p>
                    The <strong>Tyranids</strong> faction never draws <strong>Strategy Cards</strong>. Instead, they
                    have special rules that are implemented directly before <strong>Strategy Cards</strong> are drawn.

    First and foremost, 2nd Edition 40k is meant to be fun. The rules
    should serve the story you want to tell on the tabletop, not
    dictate it. Remember, the ultimate goal is a memorable, immersive
    battle that leaves everyone eager for the next game. Be a good
    sport and have fun!

        <p>
            Warhammer 40,000 is a challenging and involving game, with
            many fantastic races, and endless possibilities. In a game of
            this size and level of complexity there are bound to be some
            situations where the rules seem unclear, or a particular
            situation lies outside the rules as they are written. This is
            inevitable, as we can&apos;t possibly give rules to cover
            every circumstance. Nor would we want to try, as that would
            restrict what you can and cannot do far too much. Players
            should feel free to invent and improvise, exploring the galaxy
            of Warhammer 40,000 for themselves and taking the game far
            beyond the published rules if they wish.

Victory Points


<p>
    Players are awarded <strong>Victory Points</strong> for fulfilling certain criteria during a game. Each
    <strong>Mission Card</strong> lists the points awarded for completing its objectives. Additionally, <strong>Victory
        Points</strong> are awarded for damage done to the opponent&apos;s units, as follows:
