                    In Warhammer 40,000, each unit, model, or item is worth a certain number of
                    points&mdash;representative of its relative impact on the table. Armies are built by spending points
                    up to an agreed maximum. This is referred to as the <strong>Game Size</strong>.

                    Games can be any size, from small skirmishes up to sprawling mass battles. Some recommended games
                    sizes are:

                <p>
                    To put together an army, points are spent on units and wargear from one or more army lists. Army
                    lists detail which units and equipment are available when constructing a given force&mdash;and how
                    many points they cost&mdash;as well as any army specific rules and/or constraints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although it is not a requirement to spend every single point, it is advisable to try to use as many
                    points as possible&mdash;wargear can help with this.

                <p>
                    4 turns is considered the &quot;default&quot; length for a game; however, players can agree to alter
                    this as
                    they see fit&mdash;extending on a turn-by-turn basis until there is a clear winner, or ending it
                    prematurely if it is a foregone conclusion. Some missions or scenarios may also dictate a specific
                    game length.

                <p>
                    During this step, players construct the battlefield for the game. A basic way to do this is to
                    take turns placing terrain so that no player has a particular tactical advantage due to the
                    landscape.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another option is to work together to create a board that fits a certain narrative theme, such as a
                    pitched battle or a last stand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is no specific requirement for what type or how much terrain is placed, but the general
                    consensus is that the game plays better&mdash;and looks better&mdash;with more terrain.

                    In the simplest game of Warhammer 40,000, the objective is purely to destroy the opponent&apos;s
                    army. To give this more flavor, players can define mission objectives for each army. These can be
                    decided in one of two ways:</p>
                <h4>
                    Mission Cards
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Mission cards define one or more objectives and the rewards for accomplishing them. If both sides
                    agree, players may randomly draw one each.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Scenarios
                </h4>
                <p>
                    A scenario is a narrative through-line for a game&mdash;&quot;capture the space port&quot; or
                    &quot;hold out until
                    reinforcements arrive&quot;. A great source of inspiration for this are old White Dwarf battle
                    reports—a
                    personal favorite being <em>Last Stand at Glazer&apos;s Creek</em> from White Dwarf 222. </p>

                <p>The standard way to win a game of Warhammer 40,000 is to score the most <strong>Victory
                        Points</strong>; however, for some scenarios it may be preferable to define a specific win
                    condition&mdash;escaping from a table edge, surviving for X turns, etc.</p>

                <p>
                    The <strong>Tyranids</strong> faction never draws <strong>Strategy Cards</strong>. Instead, they
                    have special rules that are implemented directly before <strong>Strategy Cards</strong> are drawn.
